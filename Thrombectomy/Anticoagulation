It is believed that because more than 30% of patients after thrombectomy do not become independent that there exist some type of microvascular thrombosis.

This is the reason why Graaf 2017 doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00238   made a review of all the  series that have been published  with some kind of anticoagulation used during thrombectomy either  with heparin or antiplatelet. they found that on average the patientâ€™s are doing slightly better then usually expected  clinically with independence ranging from 20-60% and mortality from 20-33%.  These are observational studies and there exist no randomised trial which they  proposed.
